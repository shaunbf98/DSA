DSA Project on GREP

Made by Shaun Benjamin Fernandez, 111608058

The grep utilities are a family of Unix tools that perform repetitive searching tasks. The tools in the grep family are very similar, and all are used for searching the contents of files for information that matches particular criteria.


In this Project, I have written code for the following functions.

-r  - It searches through the current directory recursively and looks for given word in all files (including sub-directories and sub sub directories)                               
-i  - It is case-insensitive match of words in a given file and prints those lines                               
-v  - It only prints non-matching lines                               
-f  - Reads file and uses it as a pattern                               
-w  - Looks only for words matching given pattern                               
-c  - Counts number of matching lines                               
-m  - Stops after input number of times                               
-b  - Displays bytecount at each instance of printing                               
-q  - Quits the program                               
-H  - Prints file name along with lines                               
-h  - Default, Doesn't print file name
